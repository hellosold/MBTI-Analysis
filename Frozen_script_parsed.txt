C: GRAND PABBIE
D: I recommend we remove all magic, even memories of magic to be safe.... But don't worry, I'll leave the fun.
N: Grand Pabbie pulls out a glowing blue energy from Anna's head. We see her memories floating right above her. Grand Pabbie changes all of her magical memories to ordinary memories -- snowy play indoors with the girls in their nightgowns changes to outdoors on the winter fjords with the girls in winter gear. He puts the ordinary memories back in her head.

C: ANNA AND ELSA
D: ...Chocolate.
E: TOGETHER
N: Their eyes pop open. They laugh. Elsa looks back out at the party. Anna looks at Elsa. She wants to say so much, but she can't think of where to start. Just as she finds her way, Kai interrupts.
C: KAI
D: Your Majesty. The Duke of Weaseltown.
C: DUKE

N: Anna looks back at Elsa, desperately.
C: ELSA

C: ANNA
D: ...No. 23 FROZEN - J. Lee
C: DUKE
D: Oh, all right. Hang on. They don't call me the little dipper for nothing.

N: Anna's smile drops. She tries not to get emotional.
C: ANNA
D: Excuse me for a minute.
N: She walks away. Elsa watches her go, saddened. Moving through the crowd, Anna gets bumped by a bowing man's butt. She falls. Just before she hits the floor, Hans catches her. He smiles perfectly.

C: DUKE
D: There she is! Stop her!

D: Please, just stay away from me. Stay away!

E: CONT'D
N: Anna rushes out onto the fjord ice, slips, falls.

D: Bye bye.
N: Oaken slams the door. Kristoff sits up. His reindeer, Sven, canters over, snorts, and nudges him, expectantly.
C: KRISTOFF
D: No Sven, I didn't get your carrots.

D: Oh, it's just you. What do you want?
C: ANNA
D: I want you to take me up the North Mountain. 44 FROZEN - J. Lee
C: KRISTOFF
D: I don't take people places.
N: He lays back down, closes his eyes.
C: ANNA
D: Let me rephrase that...
N: A sack of supplies lands in Kristoff's lap.
C: KRISTOFF
D: Umph.
N: He sits up. Looks in the bag.
C: ANNA
D: Take me up the North Mountain.... Please.
N: He eyes her. He clearly doesn't take orders.
C: ANNA
D: Look, I know how to stop this winter.
E: CONT'D
N: He considers, lies back down, pulls his hat over his eyes.
C: KRISTOFF
D: We leave at dawn.... And you forgot the carrots for Sven.
N: A bag of carrots hits Kristoff in the face.
C: KRISTOFF
D: Ugh!
E: CONT'D
C: ANNA
D: Oops. Sorry. Sorry. I'm sorry. I didn't-- We leave now. Right now.
E: catching herself
N: She steps back outside and waits, anxiously. Annoyed, Kristoff offers Sven a carrot. Sven has a bite. Then Kristoff has a bite, contemplating.
T: SLAM CUT TO:
S: EXT. MOUNTAIN HIGH -- NIGHT
N: Sven races, top speed, up a narrow cliff, pulling the sled, which skids precariously. Kristoff mans the reins. Anna sits beside him. FROZEN - J. Lee

D: Hang on! We like to go fast!
E: trying to scare Anna
C: ANNA
D: I like fast!
E: fearless
N: Anna leans back and puts her feet up on the dashboard.
C: KRISTOFF
D: Whoa, whoa! Get your feet down.
N: He pushes her feet down.
C: KRISTOFF
D: This is fresh lacquer. Seriously, were you raised in a barn?
E: CONT'D
N: Kristoff spits on the dash to clean it. The spit flies back and hits Anna in the face.
C: ANNA
D: Ew. No, I was raised in a castle.
E: grossed out
N: She wipes off her face.
C: KRISTOFF
D: So tell me, what made the Queen go all ice-crazy?
C: ANNA
D: ...Oh well, it was all my fault. I got engaged but then she freaked out because I'd only just met him, you know, that day. And she said she wouldn't bless the marriage--
C: KRISTOFF
D: Wait. You got engaged to someone you just met?
C: ANNA
D: Yeah. Anyway, I got mad and so she got mad and then she tried to walk away, and I grabbed her glove--
C: KRISTOFF
D: Hang on. You mean to tell me you got engaged to someone you just met?! 46 FROZEN - J. Lee
C: ANNA
D: Yes. Pay attention. But the thing is she wore the gloves all the time, so I just thought, maybe she has a thing about dirt.
C: KRISTOFF
D: Didn't your parents ever warn you about strangers?
N: Anna eyes Kristoff up and down, then slides away from him.
C: ANNA
D: Yes, they did.... But Hans is not a stranger.
C: KRISTOFF
D: Oh yeah? What's his last name?
C: ANNA
D: ...Of-the-Southern-Isles?
C: KRISTOFF
D: What's his favorite food?
C: ANNA
D: ...Sandwiches.
C: KRISTOFF
D: Best friend's name?

D: Probably John.
C: KRISTOFF
D: Eye color.
C: ANNA
D: Dreamy.
C: KRISTOFF
D: Foot size...?
C: ANNA
D: Foot size doesn't matter.
C: KRISTOFF
D: Have you had a meal with him yet? What if you hate the way he eats? What if you hate the way he picks his nose?
C: ANNA
D: Picks his nose? 47 FROZEN - J. Lee
C: KRISTOFF
D: And eats it.
C: ANNA
D: Excuse me, sir. He's a prince.
C: KRISTOFF
D: All men do it.
C: ANNA
D: Ew. Look it doesn't matter; it's true love.
C: KRISTOFF
D: Doesn't sound like true love.
C: ANNA
D: Are you some sort of love expert?
C: KRISTOFF
D: No. But I have friends who are.
C: ANNA
D: You have friends who are love experts.... I'm not buying it.
N: Sven suddenly stops, ears perked in alarm.
C: KRISTOFF
D: Stop talking.
E: to Anna
C: ANNA
D: No, no, no. I'd like to meet these--
N: Kristoff clamps his hand over Anna's mouth.
C: KRISTOFF
D: I mean it. SHHH.
N: Kristoff stands, looks into the dark woods surrounding them. Sensing something behind them, he holds up his lantern. Its light reflects off...EYES. Several.
C: KRISTOFF
D: Sven, go. Go!
E: CONT'D
N: Sven takes off.
C: ANNA
D: What are they?
C: KRISTOFF
D: Wolves. 48 FROZEN - J. Lee
N: Flashes of white dart through the woods. Kristoff hops into the back of the sled, grabs a torch. Lights it.
C: ANNA
D: Wolves. What do we do?
C: KRISTOFF
D: I've got this. You just...don't fall off and don't get eaten.
C: ANNA
D: But I wanna help.
C: KRISTOFF
D: No.
C: ANNA
D: Why not?
C: KRISTOFF
D: Because I don't trust your judgement.
C: ANNA
D: Excuse me?!
N: A wolf jumps at them, but Kristoff kicks it off.
C: KRISTOFF
D: Who marries a man she just met?
N: Anna grabs the lute, swings it right at Kristoff's head.
C: ANNA
D: It's true love!
N: He screams, as she...BAM!...swings past Kristoff and knocks a wolf away.
C: KRISTOFF
D: Whoa.
E: shocked
N: Just then Kristoff is yanked off the sled by another wolf. The torch goes flying. Anna catches it, shocked.
C: ANNA
D: Christopher!
N: Kristoff grabs onto a loose rope hanging from the back of the sled and holds on for dear life as he's dragged behind.
C: KRISTOFF
D: It's Kristoff! 49 FROZEN - J. Lee
N: A wolf jumps on Kristoff's back.
C: KRISTOFF
D: AH!
E: CONT'D
N: Anna thinks fast, uses the torch to light a blanket on fire.
C: ANNA
D: Duck!
N: Anna throws the flaming blanket right at him. He ducks. The blanket hits the wolves. They tumble off Kristoff.
C: KRISTOFF
D: You almost set me on fire!
N: Anna reaches out a hand, pulls Kristoff back onto the sled.
C: ANNA
D: But I didn't.
N: Sven cries out. There is a massive gorge ahead.
C: ANNA
D: Get ready to jump, Sven!
E: CONT'D
C: KRISTOFF
D: You don't tell him what to do!
N: Kristoff shoves a satchel into her arms then scoops her up.
C: KRISTOFF
D: I do!
E: CONT'D
N: Kristoff tosses Anna onto Sven, then unhooks Sven's harness from the sled.
C: KRISTOFF
D: Jump, Sven!
E: CONT'D
N: Sven jumps the gorge with Anna on his back. Kristoff goes flying off behind them, still on the sled. Anna and Sven land safely on the other side of the gorge. Kristoff's sled loses momentum. It's not going to make it. He leaps off. He flaps his arms, claws at the air. He slams into the snowy edge of the cliff. Hanging by his hands, he looks down to see his sled hit the ground far below and burst into flames. FROZEN - J. Lee
C: KRISTOFF
D: ...But I just paid it off.
E: CONT'D shocked sadness
N: Suddenly, he starts to slip. He claws at the loose snow, but it's clearly hopeless. He's going down.
C: KRISTOFF
D: Uh-oh. No, no, no.
E: CONT'D
N: To make matters worse, an AXE comes flying right at his face.
C: KRISTOFF
D: AH! NO, NO, NO!
E: CONT'D
N: The axe slams into the snow, inches from his nose.
C: ANNA
D: Grab on!
E: O.S.
N: Kristoff grabs on.
C: ANNA
D: Pull, Sven! Pull!
E: CONT'D
N: REVEAL: The axe is tied to a rope, then wrapped around Sven. Anna helps Sven pull Kristoff to safety. Kristoff rolls onto his back, exhausted. Anna peeks down at the burning sled.
C: ANNA
D: Whoa.... I'll replace your sled and everything in it.
E: CONT'D
N: Kristoff groans.
C: ANNA
D: And I understand if you don't want to help me anymore.
E: CONT'D
N: Anna walks off, sadly. Sven comes over and nuzzles Kristoff.
C: KRISTOFF
D: Of course I don't want to help her anymore. In fact, this whole thing has ruined me for helping anyone ever again.
C: KRISTOFF
D: But she'll die on her own.
E: AS SVEN CONT'D
C: KRISTOFF
D: I can live with that. 51 FROZEN - J. Lee
E: AS SELF CONT'D
N: Through their conversation, they watch Anna go the wrong way...turn, go the other wrong way, turn, trip...
C: KRISTOFF
D: But you won't get your new sled if she's dead.
E: AS SVEN CONT'D
C: KRISTOFF
D: ...You know sometimes I really don't like you.
E: CONT'D knowing he's got a point
N: Sven licks Kristoff happily.

D: ...But it'll be fine. Elsa will thaw it.
C: KRISTOFF

N: He points her finger up towards a perilously mighty mountain.
T: DISSOLVE TO:
S: INT. FROZEN WILLOW TREES -- DAY
N: Anna, Kristoff, and Sven walk beneath frozen willows. The hanging branches glisten like Christmas lights. Sven knocks them with his antlers. They tinkle like chimes.
C: ANNA
D: I never knew winter could be so beautiful.
N: Suddenly, a voice comes in from nowhere. We'll call that voice OLAF.
C: OLAF
D: YEAH...It really is beautiful, isn't it? But it's so white. You know, how about a little color? Must we bleach the joy out of it all? I'm thinking like maybe some crimson, chartreuse...
E: O.S.
N: While this is going on, Anna and Kristoff look around for the source of the rambling. They look at Sven - could he actually be talking? Sven looks back at them, his antlers tangled in branches, just as baffled as they are. In the meantime, a nose-less snowman, Olaf, wanders up behind them.
C: OLAF
D: How `bout yellow--no, not yellow. Yellow and snow? Brrrr...no go.
E: CONT'D
N: He stops between Kristoff and Anna. They look down at him. How did he get there? He suddenly looks up at Anna.
C: OLAF Am I right?
D: 53 FROZEN - J. Lee
E: CONT'D
N: Anna SCREAMS! Reflexes take over and she kicks Olaf's head, sending it flying off his body and into Kristoff's arms.
C: OLAF
D: Hi!
E: CONT'D cheery, to Kristoff
C: KRISTOFF
D: You're creepy.
N: Kristoff tosses the head back to Anna and they commence a game of hot potato.

D: Backatchya!
C: OLAF
D: Please don't drop me.
C: ANNA
D: Don't!

D: Come on, it's just a head.
C: ANNA
D: No!
N: Olaf's body runs at Anna, arms waving.
C: OLAF
D: All right, we got off to a bad start.
E: O.S.
C: ANNA
D: Ew, ew, the body!
N: Anna slams Olaf's head back on the body, upside down. Olaf smiles happily, then looks confused.
C: OLAF
D: Wait, what am I looking at right now? Why are you hanging off the earth like a bat?
C: ANNA
D: ...Okay. Wait one second.
E: sympathetic
N: Anna kneels in front of Olaf and rights his head. FROZEN - J. Lee
C: OLAF
D: Oooh! Thank you!
C: ANNA
D: You're welcome.
C: OLAF
D: Now I'm perfect.
N: She looks over his innocent face, gets an idea.
C: ANNA
D: Well, almost.
N: She digs into Kristoff's satchel, holds up a carrot just as Olaf turns toward her. The carrot accidentally slams all the way through his head.
C: OLAF
D: Woo! Head rush!
C: ANNA
D: Oh! Too hard. I'm sorry! I-I, I was just.... Are you okay?
N: Olaf sees a tiny piece of carrot sticking out between his eyes. He lights up.
C: OLAF
D: Are you kidding me? I am wonderful! I've always wanted a nose. So cute. It's like a little baby unicorn.
E: going cross-eyed to look at his tiny nose
N: Anna reaches behind Olaf to the bulk of the carrot sticking out the back of his head, and pushes it forward.
C: OLAF
D: What? Hey! Whoa. Oh, I love it even more! Hah.... All right, let's start this thing over. Hi everyone. I'm Olaf. And I like warm hugs.
E: CONT'D seeing his now big nose
N: Olaf opens his arms wide to Anna. That triggers a memory. It takes her a moment to place it, but then she does.
C: ANNA
D: Olaf?...That's right, Olaf. 55 FROZEN - J. Lee
C: OLAF
D: ...And you are?
C: ANNA
D: Oh, um...I'm Anna.

E: accepting it
N: Sven tries to bite Olaf's nose.

D: Ha. Aw, look at him tryin' to kiss my nose. I like you, too!
E: CONT'D gushes
C: ANNA
D: Olaf, did Elsa build you?
C: OLAF
D: Yeah. Why?
N: Curious, Kristoff takes one of Olaf's twig arms off, studies it. It seems to be moving in sync with his other arm.
C: ANNA
D: Do you know where she is?
C: KRISTOFF
D: Fascinating...
E: studying the arm
C: OLAF
D: Yeah. Why? 56 FROZEN - J. Lee
C: ANNA
D: Do you think you could show us the way?
C: OLAF
D: Yeah. Why?
C: KRISTOFF
D: How does this work?
E: bending the arm
N: Olaf's dismembered arm slaps Kristoff across the face.
C: OLAF
D: Stop it, Sven. Trying to focus here. Yeah, why?
E: to Anna
C: KRISTOFF
D: I'll tell you why. We need Elsa to bring back summer.
C: OLAF
D: Summer? Oh, I don't know why but I've always loved the idea of summer, and sun, and all things hot.
E: shocked sinking into wistfulness
C: KRISTOFF

N: Anna starts to climb the stairs.
C: ANNA
D: ...I'm so sorry about what happened. If I'd known--
N: Elsa backs up, away from Anna.
C: ELSA
D: No, it's okay. You don't have to apologize.... But you should probably go, please.
E: on guard
C: ANNA
D: But I just got here.
C: ELSA
D: ...You belong in Arendelle.
C: ANNA
D: So do you.
N: Anna takes another step up. Elsa backs up more.
C: ELSA
D: No, I belong here. Alone. Where I can be who I am without hurting anybody.
C: ANNA
D: ...Actually, about that--
C: OLAF
D: 58...59...60.
E: O.S.
C: ELSA
D: Wait. What is that?
N: Olaf comes running in the front door. He waves.
C: OLAF
D: Hi, I'm Olaf and I like warm hugs.
C: ELSA
D: Olaf?
E: shocked
N: Olaf stops beside Anna, looks up at Elsa, intimidated. FROZEN - J. Lee
C: OLAF
D: You built me. You remember that?
E: bashful
C: ELSA
D: And you're alive?
E: astonished
C: OLAF
D: Um...I think so?
N: Anna kneels down beside Olaf.
C: ANNA
D: He's just like the one we built as kids.... We were so close. We can be like that again.
N: Elsa smiles, but then a memory returns to her.
T: FLASH CUT TO:

D: Elsa, wait--
C: ELSA
D: I'm just trying to protect you.

C: ELSA
D: WHAT DO I NOT KNOW?
C: ANNA
D: ARENDELLE'S IN DEEP DEEP DEEP DEEP SNOW.
C: ELSA
D: What?
N: Elsa looks past Anna's shoulder out white-peaked mountains.
C: ANNA
D: You kind of set off an eternal winter...everywhere.
C: ELSA
D: Everywhere?
C: ANNA
D: It's okay, you can just unfreeze it.

D: WE CAN FACE THIS THING TOGETHER...
N: But as Anna sings, we lose sight of her in the thickening blizzard taking over the room.
C: ELSA
D: NO!
C: ANNA
D: WE CAN CHANGE THIS WINTER WEATHER, AND EVERYTHING WILL BE...
E: O.S.
N: Anna's voice disappears in the storm as Elsa cries out.
C: ELSA
D: I CAN'T!
N: Elsa's fear, so strong, sucks the blizzard back into her and then it bursts out, unwittingly, like a sharp snowflake. Anna is STRUCK right in the heart. She grasps her chest in pain and stumbles back. She falls to her knees. Elsa gasps when she sees Anna. Just then, Olaf and Kristoff rush into the room to Anna's side.
C: KRISTOFF
D: Anna. Are you okay? 71 FROZEN - J. Lee
C: ANNA
D: I'm okay.... I'm fine.
N: Anna gets to her feet, determined to hide the pain.
C: ELSA
D: Who's this? Wait, it doesn't matter. You have to go.
E: scared
C: ANNA
D: No, I know we can figure this out together--
C: ELSA
D: How? What power do you have to stop this winter? To stop me?
E: desperate
N: Anna doesn't have the answer. Kristoff sees spiky ice shadows creeping down the walls. Puts a protective arm around Anna.
C: KRISTOFF
D: Anna, I think we should go.
C: ANNA
D: No. I'm not leaving without you, Elsa.
E: close to tears
C: ELSA
D: Yes, you are.

T: SLAM CUT TO:
S: EXT. ICE PALACE -- DAY
N: Marshmallow holds Anna and Kristoff by the scruff of their necks in one hand and Olaf in the other.
C: ANNA

D: You are a lot stronger than I think you realize.
E: to Marshmallow
N: Marshmallow tosses Kristoff and Anna down the steps. FROZEN - J. Lee
C: MARSHMALLOW
D: Go away!
E: like a bouncer
N: Anna and Kistoff slide past Sven, who's got his tongue stuck to the ice railing.
C: OLAF
D: Heads up!
E: O.S.
N: Olaf's head smashes into a snowbank nearby.
C: ANNA
D: Olaf!
C: OLAF
D: Watch out for my butt!
N: Anna and Kristoff duck as the rest of Olaf slams into the snowbank. Marshmallow turns to go back into the castle. Incensed, Anna tries to march back up the stairs.
C: ANNA
D: It is not nice to throw people!
N: Kristoff grabs her, pulls her back.
C: KRISTOFF ANNA
D: All right feisty pants. Calm Let me at him. I want to get down. Woaw. Just let the snow him. I.... Okay. I'm Calm. man be.
N: Anna backs down...for a moment. Then she grabs a snowball and throws it at Marshmallow. The tiny little ball hits Marshmallow's back, not making even the slightest dent. But it's enough to infuriate him. He ROARS. Spikes shoot out of his joints.
C: KRISTOFF
D: Uh-oh. Now you made him mad!
C: OLAF
D: ...I'll distract him. You guys go.
N: Kristoff pushes Anna along. Sven runs off in the opposite direction. Olaf's belly and butt fall and follow Sven.
C: OLAF
D: No, no, not you guys. 73 FROZEN - J. Lee
E: CONT'D
N: Marshmallow goes charging after Anna and Kristoff as Olaf's head falls and lands face down in snow.
C: OLAF
D: This just got a whole lot harder.
E: CONT'D muffled
N: Anna and Kristoff leap and slide down a steep slope. They tumble to a stop at the bottom just as Marshmallow lands hard right behind them. They're off again...through a maze of conifers that sag under the weight of the snow, Marshmallow hot on their trail.
C: KRISTOFF
D: This way!
N: Anna grabs a branch of a sagging trees and releases all of the snow. The tree snaps upright, knocking Marshmallow back.
C: KRISTOFF
D: Ho-ho-ho!
E: CONT'D impressed
C: ANNA
D: I got him!
N: Anna and Kristoff burst out of the conifer forest and almost run right off a cliff. They stop short, toes on the edge.
C: KRISTOFF
D: Whoa, stop!
C: ANNA
D: It's a hundred foot drop.
C: KRISTOFF
D: It's two hundred.
N: Kristoff ties the rope around Anna and pulls tight.
C: ANNA
D: Ow.
N: He drops to his knees and starts digging a u-shape in the snow with a pick axe.
C: ANNA
D: What's that for?
E: CONT'D
C: KRISTOFF
D: I'm digging a snow anchor. 74 FROZEN - J. Lee
C: ANNA
D: Okay. What if we fall?
E: not trusting
C: KRISTOFF
D: There's twenty feet of fresh powder down there; it'll be like landing on a pillow.... Hopefully.
N: They hear an angry ROAR coming closer.
C: KRISTOFF
D: Okay, Anna. On three.
E: CONT'D
N: Anna preps for the jump like a boxer getting ready to fight.
C: ANNA
D: Okay. You tell me when...
C: KRISTOFF
D: One...
C: ANNA
D: ...I'm ready to go....
C: KRISTOFF
D: Two...
C: ANNA
D: ...I was BORN ready! Yes!
E: pumped up
C: KRISTOFF
D: Calm down.
N: A huge tree flies through the air toward them.
C: ANNA
D: TREE!
E: O.S.
N: Anna jumps and pulls Kristoff over the edge with her. They hang upside down over the cliff by the rope. The rope catches their fall.
C: KRISTOFF
D: Whoa! That happened.
N: Back up top, Olaf emerges from the woods. He's a complete mess, all his body parts are in the wrong places. He huffs and puffs, struggling to run.
C: OLAF
D: Ah. Ah. Man, am I out of shape. 75 FROZEN - J. Lee
N: He stops. Puts his body back together in the right order.
C: OLAF
D: There we go. Hey, Anna! Sven! Where'd ya guys go? We totally lost Marshmallow back there!
E: CONT'D
N: Marshmallow steps up behind Olaf. Olaf turns to face him.
C: OLAF
D: Hey. We were just talking about you. All good things, all good things.
E: CONT'D happily
N: Marshmallow roars and approaches Kristoff's snow anchor.
C: OLAF
D: NO!
E: CONT'D
N: Olaf jumps onto Marshmallow's leg trying to stop him, but not making much of a difference.
C: OLAF
D: This is not making much of a difference!
E: CONT'D
N: Marshmallow flicks Olaf off his leg and right over the cliff.
C: OLAF
D: WHOA!
E: CONT'D
N: Olaf passes Anna and Kristoff.
C: ANNA
D: Olaf!
C: OLAF
D: Hang in there, guys!
N: Marshmallow starts yanking Kristoff and Anna's rope up.
C: ANNA
D: Wait, what?
N: Kristoff's head hits the cliff.
C: KRISTOFF
D: Aargghh!
N: Kristoff passes out and hangs like a rag doll.
C: ANNA
D: Kristoff! 76 FROZEN - J. Lee
N: Marshmallow pulls them up. He roars and breathes snow all over them.
C: MARSHMALLOW
D: Don't come back!
C: ANNA
D: Ugh. We won't.
E: grossed out by his snow breath
N: Anna whips out a knife and cuts the rope. Kristoff comes to just as they fall. They both SCREAM! SLAM! REVEAL: Anna opens her eyes to find herself buried up to her shoulders in the soft thick snow. She laughs.
C: ANNA
D: Hey, you were right. Just like a pillow.
E: CONT'D
N: She looks up to see Olaf's upper half hanging onto Kristoff's boots, which are sticking out of the snow.
C: OLAF
D: I can't feel my legs! I can't feel my legs!
E: shaking the boots
N: Suddenly, Kristoff's head pops up. He spits out snow.
C: KRISTOFF
D: Those are my legs.
N: Olaf's bottom goes running by.
C: OLAF
D: Ooh. Hey, do me a favor, grab my butt.
E: to Kristoff
N: Kristoff grabs Olaf's head and puts it on his body.
C: OLAF
D: Oh, that feels better.
E: CONT'D
N: Sven walks up and sniffs Olaf's nose.
C: OLAF
D: Hey, Sven! 77 FROZEN - J. Lee
E: CONT'D
N: Olaf turns to Anna and Kristoff just as Sven goes to bite off his nose -- and misses.
C: OLAF
D: He found us. Who's my cute little reindeer?
E: CONT'D to Sven, funny voice
C: KRISTOFF
D: Don't talk to him like that.
N: Kristoff goes over to help Anna, who is stuck in the snow.
C: KRISTOFF
D: Here.

N: She touches the spot where he banged his head.
C: KRISTOFF
D: Ah! Ooh!
E: in pain
N: He catches himself. Waves off the pain with a giggle.
C: KRISTOFF
D: I mean, It's fine. Ah...I'm good. Ha. I've got a thick skull.
E: CONT'D

C: KRISTOFF
D: Now what?
E: CONT'D shy

E: shy then...panicking
C: KRISTOFF
D: Hey, hey, don't worry about my ice business... Worry about your hair?!
E: noticing something
N: She thinks he means it looks bad. She smooths it down.
C: ANNA
D: What? I just fell off a cliff. You should see your hair.
C: KRISTOFF
D: No, yours is turning white.
N: She grabs her braid as a tendril turns white.
C: ANNA
D: White? It's what?
C: KRISTOFF
D: It's because she struck you; isn't it?
C: ANNA
D: Does it look bad?
C: KRISTOFF
D: ...No.
E: thinking
N: Olaf's head pops up. He's holding his head up off his body to join the conversation.
C: OLAF
D: You hesitated.
C: KRISTOFF
D: No, I didn't. Anna, you need help. Now, come on. 79 FROZEN - J. Lee
N: He heads towards the sunset. Sven and Olaf follow.
C: OLAF
D: Okay! Where are we going?
C: KRISTOFF
D: To see my friends.
C: ANNA
D: The love experts?
E: catching up
C: OLAF
D: Love experts?!
C: KRISTOFF
D: Yes. And don't worry; they'll be able to fix this.
C: ANNA
D: How do you know?
N: He looks her over, remembering the moment he saw the trolls heal her as a child.
C: KRISTOFF
D: ...Because I've seen them do it before.
N: As they round the bend, the sun sets and Olaf turns to Sven.
C: OLAF
D: I like to consider myself a love expert.
T: CUT TO:
S: INT. ELSA'S PALACE -- DAY
N: Elsa paces, distraught. She talks to herself.
C: ELSA
D: Get it together. Control it. Don't feel. Don't feel. Don't FEEL!
E: mantra-style
N: She hears ice cracking. Stops. Looks around. She's left a sharp wake of ice spikes behind her on the floor. They grow up the wall, taking over the castle.
T: DISSOLVE TO:
N: FROZEN - J. Lee
S: EXT. BLACK MOUNTAINS -- NIGHT
N: The Northern Lights are bright. Olaf stares at them in awe as he rides on Sven's back.
C: OLAF
D: Look, Sven. The sky's awake.
N: Behind Olaf and Sven, Anna walks with Kristoff. She shivers.
C: KRISTOFF
D: Are you cold?
C: ANNA
D: ...A little.
N: He reaches like he might put an arm around her, but decides against it. He looks around as if he doesn't know what to do, then gets a thought.
C: KRISTOFF
D: Wait. Come here.
N: He takes her hand and pulls her around a bend into a rock- lined pass. Steam vents, powered by the volcanic activity, dot the path. He holds her hands over one of them.
C: ANNA
D: Oooh.... That's nice.
N: They continue on the path, walking from vent to vent.
C: KRISTOFF
D: So, about my friends...well, I say friends, they're more like family.... Anyway, when I was a kid, it was just me and Sven...until they took me in.
E: taking a deep breath

C: KRISTOFF
D: Meet my family.
E: CONT'D
N: REVEAL: he's surrounded by rocks.
C: KRISTOFF
D: Hey, guys!
E: CONT'D to the rocks
N: As Kristoff and Sven move through the rocks, waving and greeting, Olaf and Anna stand frozen, dumbfounded.
C: ANNA
D: ...They're rocks.
E: to herself
C: OLAF
D: He's crazy. I'll distract them while you run. Hi, Sven's family! It's nice to meet you! Anna, because I love you, I insist you run. I understand you're love experts! Why aren't you running?
E: realizing covertly, to Anna Loud and slow to a rock quietly to Anna to the rock to Anna

N: He then stops, confused, and looks to one of the trolls.
C: OLAF
D: Wait? Kristoff?
E: CONT'D
N: Anna watches, shocked and confused. The trolls all want Kristoff's attention. One troll yanks him down with a boulder's strength.
C: TROLL ONE
D: Oh, lemme look at you!
N: Another troll tries to pull off his clothes.
C: TROLL TWO
D: Oh, take off your clothes, Kristoff; I wash them.

C: PICK ME UP TROLL

C: ANNA
D: What's going on?
C: KRISTOFF
D: I've learned to just roll with it.

D: Help us out, Sven.
N: Kristoff grabs Sven's antlers. Sven pulls them out. Kristoff helps Anna onto Sven and hops up behind her.
C: KRISTOFF
D: Come on, Olaf!
E: CONT'D
N: Sven takes off. Olaf grabs Sven's tail, rides with them.
C: OLAF
D: I'm coming! Let's go kiss Hans! Who is this Hans?!
T: CUT TO:
S: EXT. ELSA'S PALACE - DAWN
N: Hans and the men tread cautiously towards the castle.
C: HANS
D: We are here to find Princess Anna. Be on guard, but no harm is to come to the Queen. Do you understand?
N: The Duke's thugs exchange a look. Suddenly, a mass of snow rises from the ground behind Hans. It's Marshmallow, Elsa's snow guard.
C: MARSHMALLOW
D: Go away!
N: He slams a fist inches from Hans. Hans deftly dodges out of the way. All of the guards take up arms against Marshmallow, who quickly knocks them over. Marshmallow throws down a guard and his horse, who topple over Hans. Marshmallow raises his foot to stomp on Hans, but Hans barrel-rolls himself to safety. He sees his sword, leaps, and grabs it. Just then, Elsa peeks out the front doors. The Duke's two thugs see her.
C: DUKE'S THUG
D: The Queen.
N: The thugs charge up the stairs. FROZEN - J. Lee
S: INT. ELSA'S PALACE -- DAY
N: They guards burst through the ice doors. Elsa flees to the top floor of her palace. The guards pursue. They trap her on the top floor, raise their crossbows.
C: ELSA
D: No. Please.
E: scared
N: One of the thugs shoots an arrow right at Elsa. At the last moment she creates an ice wall. It stops the arrow, inches from her face. The thugs reposition to take another shot.
C: ELSA
D: Stay away!
E: CONT'D
N: Elsa shoots ice at the thugs. They duck out of the way and continue the attack.
C: THUG
D: Get her! Get her!
N: Elsa fights for her life. BACK OUTSIDE: Hans is nearly crushed by Marshmallow. He rolls away. Jumps to his feet. And with agile might, he slices Marshmallow's leg off with his sword. Marshmallow stumbles back, off balance. And falls off over the cliff, but not before striking Hans. Hans goes over the edge. REVEAL: Hans clings to the ice steps. His men help him up and they rush into the ice palace.
S: INT. ICE PALACE -- DAY
N: Elsa is surrounded. It's do or die. In two swift moves, Elsa traps one thug in a cage of spikes that threaten his neck. The other she pushes back with a wall of ice....up against the balcony doors...which BURST and CRACK. OUT ONTO THE BALCONY.... The balcony doors shatter. The thug is pushed to the edge. He's inches away from falling to his death. BACK INSIDE: Hans and his men run in. See the destruction and the thugs near death. FROZEN - J. Lee
C: HANS
D: Queen Elsa! Don't be the monster they fear you are.
N: Elsa snaps out of her rage. She sees the men, frightened, moments from death. She stops. Elsa looks to Hans, overwhelmed, frightened. The wall retreats from the thug on the balcony. The ice spikes lower from the second thug's neck. He takes advantage and aims his crossbow at Elsa's back. Seeing it. Hans runs and pushes the crossbow up just as the arrow releases. The arrow hits the ice chandelier, hanging directly above Elsa. The chandelier comes CRASHING DOWN. Elsa dives out of the way but she falls in the blast. All we see is ice smashing like glass, and all we hear is the sound of it shattering as it rings out.
T: CUT TO BLACK. FADE IN ON:
N: Elsa's face as her eyes flutter open. She sits up. She's surrounded by stone.
S: INT. ARENDELLE, DUNGEON -- DAY
N: Elsa looks to the nearby window. Tries to rush to it. She's pulled taut by giant shackles that fit like iron gloves. She's chained to the wall. Elsa strains to looks out a window... INSET WINDOW: Arendelle is outside, frozen solid and getting further buried under the ice and snow that is falling.
C: ELSA
D: No....What have I done?
N: Hans enters. He hangs a torch by the door.
C: ELSA
D: Why did you bring me here?
E: CONT'D
C: HANS
D: I couldn't just let them kill you. 91 FROZEN - J. Lee
C: ELSA
D: But I'm a danger to Arendelle. Get Anna.
C: HANS
D: Anna has not returned....
N: Elsa looks to the storm with worry.
C: HANS
D: If you would just stop the winter, bring back summer...please.
E: CONT'D
N: Elsa meets his eyes, desperate.
C: ELSA
D: Don't you see...I can't.
N: Hans sees the sincerity in her eyes.
C: ELSA
D: You have to tell them to let me go.
E: CONT'D
N: Hans walks to the door. He takes the torch.
C: HANS
D: I will do what I can.
N: He opens the door and leaves. Elsa, distraught, hears cracking. She looks down as her shackles begin to freeze over. The storm outside picks up.
T: CUT TO:
S: EXT. THE FJORDS -- DAY
N: Sven charges down the mountain with Kristoff and Anna on his back. Olaf slides along beside them, penguin-style. Anna shivers in Kristoff's arms. She's weakening. Kristoff takes off his hat and puts it on her head.
C: KRISTOFF
D: Just hang in there. Come on, buddy, faster!
E: to Sven
N: They arrive at the walls of Arendelle. Olaf slides past them, out of control.
C: OLAF
D: I'll meet you guys at the castle! 92 FROZEN - J. Lee
C: KRISTOFF
D: Stay out of sight, Olaf!
C: OLAF

E: O.S.
T: CUT TO:
S: EXT. CASTLE COURTYARD -- DAY
N: Guards see Kristoff and Anna approaching.
C: GUARD
D: It's Princess Anna!
N: Sven skids to a stop outside the gates. Kristoff slides off, holding Anna, and carries her to the gate.
C: KRISTOFF
D: I've got you.
N: Anna looks up at him, gratefully.
C: ANNA
D: ...Are you g-gonna be okay?
C: KRISTOFF
D: Don't worry about me.
E: touched, reassuring
N: Just then the castle gates open. Gerda, Kai, and a handmaid rush to help Anna.
C: GERDA
D: Anna! Oh, you had us worried sick.
C: KAI
D: My Lady. You are freezing.
C: GERDA
D: You poor girl, you're freezing. Let's get you inside. 93 FROZEN - J. Lee
C: KRISTOFF
D: Get her warm and find Prince Hans, immediately.
C: KAI
D: We will. Thank you.
N: Anna is swept away from Kristoff and into the palace grounds.
C: KRISTOFF
D: Make sure she's safe!
N: Kristoff is shut out as the castle gates close on him. Kristoff stands there with Sven for a beat, staring with worry at the closed gates. Finally, he sighs, turns and walks off. Sven reluctantly follows.
T: CUT TO:
S: INT. LIBRARY -- DAY
N: Hans stands with the dignitaries and guards.
C: HANS
D: I'm going back out to look for Princess Anna.
C: FRENCH DIGNITARY
D: You cannot risk going out there again.
C: HANS
D: If anything happens to her--
C: SPANISH DIGNITARY
D: If anything happens to the Princess, you are all Arendelle has left.
N: Hans hesitates, realizing how much this kingdom has come to depend on him. Is he really all they have left? Just then the door opens and Gerda and Kai bring in Anna.
C: KAI
D: He's in here. Prince Hans.
C: HANS
D: Anna. 94 FROZEN - J. Lee
N: Hans rushes to Anna. She falls into his arms.
C: HANS
D: You're so cold.
E: CONT'D
C: ANNA
D: Hans, you have to kiss me.
E: weak, but desperate
C: HANS
D: What?
C: ANNA
D: Now. Here we go.
N: She tries to kiss him, but is too weak to pull herself up in his arms.
C: GERDA
D: We'll give you two some privacy.
N: Everyone shuffles out, leaving Hans and Anna alone.
C: HANS
D: What happened out there?
C: ANNA
D: Elsa struck me with her powers.
C: HANS
D: You said she'd never hurt you.
C: ANNA
D: I was wrong.
N: Anna crumbles, weak.
C: HANS
D: Anna.
N: Hans carries her to a couch, sets her down.
C: ANNA
D: She froze my heart and only an act of true love can save me.
E: shivering more
C: HANS
D: A true love's kiss.
E: understanding
N: He takes her chin in his hand and gives her a tender smile. He leans in slowly...gently... FROZEN - J. Lee Then he stops.
C: HANS
D: Oh, Anna. If only there was someone out there who loved you.
E: CONT'D
C: ANNA
D: What?
N: Hans gets up, leaving her there.
C: ANNA
D: ...You said you did.
E: CONT'D
N: He goes to the window and shuts the curtains.
C: HANS
D: As thirteenth in line in my own kingdom, I didn't stand a chance. I knew I'd have to marry into the throne somewhere--
C: ANNA
D: What are you talking about?
C: HANS
D: As heir, Elsa was preferable, of course. But no one was getting anywhere with her. But you-
E: putting out the candles
C: ANNA
D: Hans?
C: HANS
D: You were so desperate for love you were willing to marry me, just like that.
N: Hans crosses the room, grabs a pitcher of water from a table and goes to the fireplace.
C: HANS
D: I figured, after we married, I'd have to stage a little accident for Elsa.
E: CONT'D
N: Hans pours the water on the fireplace, putting out the fire. Anna tries to stop him. She falls to the floor, weak.
C: ANNA
D: Hans. No, stop. 96 FROZEN - J. Lee
C: HANS
D: But then she doomed herself, and you were dumb enough to go after her.
C: ANNA
D: Please.
C: HANS
D: All that's left now is to kill Elsa and bring back summer.
E: chuckles
N: Hans approaches Anna.
C: ANNA
D: ...You're no match for Elsa.
N: He bends down, takes her chin in his hand again, this time not so gently.
C: HANS
D: No, you're no match for Elsa. I, on the other hand, am the hero who is going to save Arendelle from destruction.
N: She wrenches her face out of his hands.
C: ANNA
D: You won't get away with this.
E: anger
N: Hans rises and crosses to the door.
C: HANS
D: Oh, I already have.
N: Hans leaves and shuts her in, locking the door. Anna struggles to the door, yanks on the locked handle.
C: ANNA
D: Please, somebody help.
E: hoarse and weak
N: The rest of her hair turns white and she crumbles to the floor.

N: FROZEN - J. Lee
S: INT. COUNCIL CHAMBER -- NIGHT
N: The Duke looks out the window at the growing snowstorm. He rubs his arms and shivers.
C: DUKE
D: It's getting colder by the minute. If we don't do something soon, we'll all freeze to death.
N: Hans comes in, putting on his most distraught face.
C: SPANISH DIGNITARY
D: Prince Hans.
C: HANS
D: Princess Anna is...dead.
C: VARIOUS DIGNITARIES
D: What...? No.... Mon dieu.
N: Hans stumbles, weak with grief. The men help him to a chair.
C: DUKE
D: What happened to her?
C: HANS
D: She was killed by Queen Elsa.
C: DUKE
D: Her own sister.
C: HANS
D: At least we got to say our marriage vows...before she died in my arms.
E: really putting it on
N: He bows his head in a brilliant display of teary grief.
C: DUKE
D: There can be no doubt now; Queen Elsa is a monster and we are all in grave danger.
C: SPANISH DIGNITARY
D: Prince Hans, Arendelle looks to you.
N: Hans nods; he knows what he's being asked to do, and he'll do it with the perfect amount of authority and gravitas. FROZEN - J. Lee
C: HANS
D: With a heavy heart, I charge Queen Elsa of Arendelle with treason and sentence her to death.
S: INT. ELSA'S DUNGEON -- DAY
N: The cell ices over. Elsa looks out at the storm that is devastating Arendelle, then hears the guards approaching.
C: GUARD
D: She's dangerous. Move quickly and with resolve.
E: O.S.
N: Elsa pulls at her shackles. They crack. Just as the door busts open, the weight of the ice crumbles the walls. The men duck out of the way. Hans pushes his way into the room...sees... The back wall is blown open. Broken shackles rest on the floor. Elsa is gone.
T: CUT TO:
S: EXT. MOUNTAIN SLOPE -- DAY
N: Kristoff heads into the mountains. Sven lags behind, not wanting to follow. He looks back at the kingdom, then shakes his head. Enough. He runs past Kristoff. Stops and turns to face him. He snorts and grunts.
C: KRISTOFF
D: What is it, buddy?
N: Sven nudges Kristoff with his antlers.
C: KRISTOFF
D: Hey, watch it. What's wrong with you?
E: CONT'D
N: Sven snorts with more conviction, moos, brays.
C: KRISTOFF
D: ...I don't understand you when you talk like that. 99 FROZEN - J. Lee
E: CONT'D avoiding
N: Kristoff tries to walk on ahead, but Sven uses his antlers to lift Kristoff off the ground.
C: KRISTOFF
D: Ah! Stop it! Put me down!
E: CONT'D
N: Sven drops him hard then "yells" at him once more.
C: KRISTOFF
D: No, Sven! We're not going back!
E: CONT'D
N: Sven shakes his head, angrily.
C: KRISTOFF
D: She's with her true love.
E: CONT'D
N: Sven makes an "of-course-she-isn't" face. Kristoff gets it; he's made his point. Just then the wind picks up. Kristoff looks back at the kingdom. Sees a violent winter storm swirling over the castle. Sharp ice claws its way up the castle, encasing it.
C: KRISTOFF
D: Anna.
E: CONT'D
N: Without hesitating, he dashes back down the mountain. Sven runs after him, catches up. Kristoff grabs Sven's harness and jumps onto his back.
T: CUT TO:
S: INT. LIBRARY -- NIGHT
N: Anna shivers by the door. She looks up to see ice overtaking the ceiling. The door handle suddenly jiggles. Stops. Jiggles again.
C: ANNA
D: Help.
E: barely a whisper
N: CLICK. The door swings open. We see a carrot in the lock and hear a giggle of victory. Olaf takes the carrot, puts it back on his face. Then he sees Anna lying there.
C: OLAF
D: Anna. Oh no.
N: He runs to the fireplace. Throws in some fresh wood, including one of his own arms, which he quickly rescues, before striking a match and relighting the fire. FROZEN - J. Lee
C: ANNA
D: Olaf? Olaf. Get away from there.
C: OLAF
D: Whoa! So this is heat.... I love it.
E: considering
N: He reaches a twig finger toward the flames. It catches on fire.
C: OLAF
D: Ooh! But don't touch it!
E: CONT'D
N: He shakes the flame out, as he rushes over to help Anna to the fire.
C: OLAF
D: So, where's Hans? What happened to your kiss?
E: CONT'D
C: ANNA
D: I was wrong about him. It wasn't true love.
C: OLAF
D: Huh. But we ran all the way here?
E: confused innocence
C: ANNA
D: Please Olaf, you can't stay here; you'll melt.
C: OLAF
D: I am not leaving here until we find some other act of true love to save you.
N: He sits down behind her, stubbornly. Leans his back against hers and thinks.
C: OLAF
D: ...Do you happen to have any ideas?
E: CONT'D
C: ANNA
D: I don't even know what love is.
C: OLAF
D: That's okay, I do....
E: confident
N: Olaf hops back up and puts a soothing hand on her shoulder. FROZEN - J. Lee
C: OLAF
D: Love is...putting someone else's needs before yours, like, you know, how Kristoff brought you back here to Hans and left you forever.
E: CONT'D
C: ANNA
D: ...Kristoff loves me?
C: OLAF
D: Wow, you really don't know anything about love, do you?
N: His face starts to melt.
C: ANNA
D: Olaf, you're melting.
C: OLAF
D: Some people are worth melting for.
E: sweet and reassuring
N: But then...his face REALLY melts. He panics, pushes the snow back in place.
C: OLAF
D: Just maybe not right this second.
E: CONT'D
N: Suddenly, the window blows open, cold wind sweeps in.
C: OLAF
D: Don't worry, I've got it!
E: CONT'D
N: Olaf flitters to the window. He pulls one panel of it shut but struggles with the second panel.
C: OLAF
D: We're going to get through-- Oh, wait. Hang on. I'm getting something.
E: CONT'D determined distracted
N: He breaks an icicle off the window, uses it as a telescope and sees... Kristoff and Sven running back down the mountain.
C: OLAF
D: It's Kristoff and Sven! They're coming back this way.
E: CONT'D
C: ANNA
D: ...They-they are? 102 FROZEN - J. Lee
C: OLAF
D: Wow, he's really moving fast. Huh.... I guess I was wrong. I guess Kristoff doesn't love you enough to leave you behind.
N: Anna tries to get to her feet.
C: ANNA
D: Help me up, Olaf. Please.
N: He hurries over, tumbling over the couch, knocking over the chess set and water jugs.
C: OLAF
D: No, no, no, no, no. You need to stay by the fire and keep warm.
C: ANNA
D: I need to get to Kristoff.
C: OLAF
D: Why...? Oh, oh, oh, I know why.
E: clueless realizing
N: He hops around in an excited display of hope.
C: OLAF
D: There's your act of true love, right there, riding across the fjords like a valiant, pungent reindeer king! Come on!
E: CONT'D
N: The walls crack under the ice pressure.
C: OLAF
D: Look out!

N: They rush out the room just as the ceiling collapses.
S: INT. CASTLE HALLWAY -- DAY
N: Anna and Olaf struggle down the hall. Ice spikes grow and block their path.
C: OLAF
D: We're trapped.
N: Anna looks around desperately for a way out. FROZEN - J. Lee
S: EXT. FJORD -- DAY
N: Elsa runs, but is nearly blinded by the snow and wind.
S: EXT. CASTLE -- DAY
N: Anna and Olaf bust open a window. The storm is so strong it sweeps the window panes away.
C: OLAF
D: Slide, Anna.
N: It's a long, snowy way down. But what choice do they have? They slide down the iced-covered building. Anna arrives at the bottom, weak but uninjured. Olaf gathers snow along the way. He arrives at the bottom as a giant snowball.
C: OLAF
D: We made it!
E: CONT'D
N: He shakes off the extra snow as Anna struggles to her feet.
S: EXT. FJORD -- DAY
N: Kristoff and Sven bound off the mountain and sprint across the frozen fjord waters and right into the heart of the storm. Its white-out wind pushes them back. But they fight through.
C: KRISTOFF
D: Come on, buddy, faster.
T: CUT TO:
N: Anna and Olaf reach the shore of the fjords.
C: ANNA
D: Kristoff!
N: The wind lifts Olaf up and pulls him apart. He goes swirling off into the storm.
C: OLAF
D: Keep going, Anna!
N: Anna struggles on. FROZEN - J. Lee
C: ANNA
D: Kristoff!
N: PAN TO: Kristoff rides Sven past cracking, frozen ships. Sven struggles over the uneven surface.
C: KRISTOFF
D: Come on! Come on!
N: Suddenly, a mangled ship, risen by ice, capsizes over them. They give it all they've got as debris falls all around them and the mast shatters. They make it past just as the entire ship slams down and cracks the thick ice beneath their feet. The ice opens up. Sven bravely jumps over a gap. But it's too wide. He bucks Kristoff to safety, but lands in the freezing water and disappears below.
C: KRISTOFF
D: Sven? Sven!
E: CONT'D
N: At first there's nothing but the wind and the tumbling icy water. But suddenly, Sven surfaces and claws his way to a floating ice chunk. He calls out, signalling for Kristoff to go on.
C: KRISTOFF
D: Good boy.
E: CONT'D
T: CUT TO:
N: Anna moves blindly across the fjord. Anna's hands frost over an icy blue. She stumbles on, determined. But she's running out of time. She clutches her chest. The color in her eyes fades, the inevitable is coming.
T: CUT TO:
N: Kristoff, lost in the white-out, doesn't know which way to turn. But then he hears a faint--
C: ANNA
D: Kristoff.
E: O.S.

C: WHITE OUT TO:
D: 105 FROZEN - J. Lee
N: Elsa struggles through her own storm, but the fear is consuming her. A dark shadow approaches. It's Hans.
C: HANS
D: Elsa. You can't run from this!
N: Elsa backs away from him.
C: ELSA
D: ...Just take care of my sister.
C: HANS
D: Your sister? She returned from the mountain weak and cold. She said you froze her heart.
C: ELSA
D: What? No.
C: HANS
D: I tried to save her, but it was too late. Her skin was ice. Her hair turned white...
N: Elsa's face sinks as she realizes what she has done.
C: HANS
D: Your sister is dead... because of you.
E: CONT'D
N: Elsa drops to her knees, emotionally broken. And with that, the swirling storm suddenly stops. The snow freezes mid-air, hangs suspended, trapped in grief. Citizens and dignitaries rush to the wall's edge and look out to see... Anna, barely able to move but now able to see across the fjords to...
C: ANNA
D: Kristoff.
E: a whisper
C: KRISTOFF
D: Anna.
N: Anna pushes on towards Kristoff. He runs top speed towards her. There's still a lot of fjord to cross, but Kristoff is giving it all he's got. He's going to make it. But then, Anna hears the sound of a sword being drawn from its scabbard. She turns and sees Hans, behind Elsa, as he raises his sword over his head. FROZEN - J. Lee
C: ANNA
D: Elsa.
N: Anna looks back at Kristoff as he runs for her. She gives him a longing look, but then turns away from him and then... Using all of her remaining strength, as Hans brings his sword down, Anna throws herself in front of Elsa.
C: ANNA
D: No!
E: CONT'D
N: In that instant, Anna freezes to solid ice. The sword hits her instead of Elsa. The sword shatters completely. The force of it sends Hans flying back and knocks him out.
C: ELSA
D: Anna!
N: Elsa rushes to Anna and touches her sister's frozen face.
C: ELSA
D: Oh, Anna...no...no, please no.
E: CONT'D
N: Olaf walks up and sees Anna, frozen.
C: OLAF
D: Anna?
E: confused, sad
N: Elsa hugs Anna and cries. Kristoff watches in shocked despair. Sven steps up to his side. Citizens and dignitaries on the castle walls bow their heads. All of Arendelle is joined in somber silence. But then, Anna warms. She begins to thaw. Olaf looks up and gasps. Kristoff and Sven notice, light up. Anna bends her arm and embraces Elsa.
C: ELSA
D: Wha-? Anna?
N: Anna opens her eyes. She smiles at Elsa, relieved.
C: ANNA
D: Oh, Elsa.
N: They embrace. FROZEN - J. Lee
C: ELSA
D: ...You sacrificed yourself for me?
C: ANNA
D: ...I love you.
E: weak
N: Olaf realizes what's happened. He's so excited about it, he lifts his head right off his body and exclaims--
C: OLAF
D: An act of true love will thaw a frozen heart.
C: ELSA
D: Love...will thaw... Love.... Of course.
E: processing realizing
N: Elsa looks at Anna with confidence.
C: ANNA
D: Elsa?
C: ELSA
D: Love.
N: Elsa lifts her arms, and the ground shakes and cracks. The ice and snow breaks away and rises high into the air. Beneath their feet the bow of a ship thaws. The entire fjord melts and other boats right themselves. The villagers come out to see the warmth returning. In one final wave, Elsa draws all of the snow into a giant snowflake in the sky, then waves it away, leaving only a warm summer day.
C: ANNA
D: I knew you could do it.
C: OLAF
D: Hands down, this is the best day of my life...and quite possibly the last.
E: melting, good-naturedly
C: ELSA
D: Oh, Olaf. Hang on, little guy. 108 FROZEN - J. Lee
N: Elsa waves her hand and surrounds Olaf with a swirl of cold air. He refreezes. Above his head she leaves a little, perpetually-snowing storm cloud. Olaf loves it.
C: OLAF
D: Hey, my own personal flurry.
N: Kristoff sees Hans trying to get to his feet. He marches toward him, prepared for a fight. But Anna puts up a hand and stops him.
C: ANNA
D: Uh. Uh. Uh.
N: She'll handle this. She goes over to Hans.
C: HANS
D: Anna? But she froze your heart.
E: confused
C: ANNA
D: The only frozen heart around here is yours.
N: She turns away from him, proud of her words. But not yet satisfied, she turns back and punches him right in the face.
C: HANS
D: Ah! Whoa, whoa, whoa!
N: He falls overboard. Elsa comes over to Anna and hugs her. Over her shoulder, Kristoff meets Anna's eyes. She smiles brighter, happy.

D: You have to. No returns. No exchanges. Queen's orders. She's named you the official Arendelle Ice Master and Deliverer.
N: Sven shows off the Ice-Master-and-Deliverer medal like he's king of the bucks.
C: KRISTOFF
D: What? That's not a thing.
N: But he can't help but admire her enthusiasm.
C: ANNA
D: Sure it is. And it even has a cup holder.... Do you like it?

D: I love it.... I could kiss you!
E: CONT'D
N: He drops her, suddenly embarrassed.
C: KRISTOFF
D: ...I could. I mean I'd like to. I'd... may I? We me....I mean, may we? Wait, what?
E: CONT'D
N: She gives him a quick kiss on the cheek.
C: ANNA
D: We may. 111 FROZEN - J. Lee
N: He smiles and goes for it. It's a true love's kiss, alright. We move past them to find Olaf enjoying the summer. With his snow cloud safely overhead, he's free to smell the flowers, which he does. Then sneezes his carrot nose off. Sven catches it between his teeth. Olaf gasps as Sven sucks the whole carrot into his mouth. It's gone. Olaf's face sinks in sadness. But not to fear, Sven spits the carrot back out and jams it into Olaf's face where it belongs. It's completely covered in reindeer spit, but Olaf doesn't seem to mind. He hugs Sven happily.
T: CUT TO:
S: EXT. CASTLE COURTYARD -- DAY
N: The gates to the castle are wide open. In the courtyard, stands Elsa.
C: ELSA
D: Are you ready?
N: Villagers cheer. Elsa stops and creates an ice rink. The people, skates at the ready, hope onto it and twirl about. Elsa then freezes the fountain in a beautiful design and adds some snow flurries for atmosphere. Anna comes slipping in. Elsa catches her.
C: ANNA
D: I like the open gates.
C: ELSA
D: We are never closing them again.
N: Elsa then waves her hand and magical ice skates (literally made of ice) form on Anna's boots.
C: ANNA
D: What? Oh, Elsa, they're beautiful, but you know I don't ska--
N: Elsa grabs Anna's hands and pulls her along on the ice. Anna slips and slides, but laughs in delight. Sven goes slipping past. Kristoff runs after him.
C: KRISTOFF
D: Look out. Reindeer coming through! 112 FROZEN - J. Lee
N: Olaf skates and helps Elsa coach Anna.
C: OLAF
D: That's it. Glide and pivot and glide and pivot.
N: We pull away slowly, into the sky. We arrive at a bird's-eye view to see that where the castle had crumbled has been repaired with a ice. All is right in Arendelle.
T: FINAL FADE OUT.
N: THE END
