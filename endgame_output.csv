TONY,"Good sport. Have fun?,This thing on? Hey, Ms. Potts. Pep. If you find this recording, don’t post it on social media. It’s going to be a real tearjerker.,I don’t know if you’re ever going to see these. I don’t even know if you’re still...God, I hope so. Today’s day twenty-one, no...twenty- two.,You know, if it wasn’t for the existential terror of staring into the literal void of space, I’d say I’m feeling a little better today. Infection’s run its course, thanks to the Blue Meanie back there. You’d like her. She’s very practical. And only a tiny bit sadistic.,The fuel cells were cracked during battle, but we figured out a way to reverse the ion charge. Bought ourselves about 48 hours of flight time. Problem is that was about...49 hours ago.,Which means, we’re dead in the water. A thousand light years from the nearest 7-11.,Most of the quote-unquote ‘food’ and potable water ran out two weeks ago.,Pep, I know I said no more surprises. But, I gotta say, I was really hoping to pull off one last one. But it looks like...well, you know what it looks like.,Don’t feel bad about this. I mean, actually, if you grovel for a couple weeks, and then move on with enormous guilt...I should probably lie down for a minute, rest my eyes. Please know, when I drift off, it will be like every day lately. I’m fine, totally fine. I’m going to dream about you. It’s always you.,I couldn’t stop him.,I lost the kid.,Is Pepper...?,I’m not going anywhere.,Where is he now?,What’s his deal?,Until this second, I literally thought you were a Build-a-Bear.,Who told you that? I didn’t fight him, he wiped my face with a planet while a Bleecker Street magician gave away the store. There was no fight because he’s not beatable.,I saw this coming, few years back. Didn’t wanna believe. I thought I was dreaming...,And I needed you, as in past tense. That trumps what you need. It’s too late, buddy. You know what I need?,I need a shave and a burger, not a bowl of soup. And I believe I remember telling all of you, alive and otherwise, that we needed a suit of armor around the world, whether it impacted our precious freedoms or not-,I said we’d lose, you said we’d “do that together, too.” Guess what, Cap, we lost, and you weren’t there. But that’s what we do, right? Our best work after the fact? We’re the “Avengers”, not the “Pre-vengers-”,I’ve got nothing for ya, Cap. No coordinates, no clues, no strategies, no options. Zero, zip, nada. No trust. Here. You take this. You find him, you put this on, and hide. I’m fine!,Morgan H. Stark. Chow time. Want some lunch?,You should not be wearing that. It’s part of a special anniversary gift I made for Mom. You thinking about lunch?,Where’d you find this?,You like going in the garage? So does Daddy. It’s all right. Mommy never wears what I buy her.,I just want to thank you folks for dropping by. It’s not every day one gets to contemplate biting it on an inter-dimensional timescape.,So you’re calling it a plan. To me, it sounds like an exotic suicide method. Not to mention, it’s impossible.,Quantum fluctuation kinda messes with the Planck Scale, which then triggers the Deutsch Proposition, can we agree on that? Chai? In layman’s terms, it means you can cancel your Netflix subscription because you’re not coming home.,Which was a billion-to-one cosmic fluke. Now you want to pull a- What are you calling it?,Oh, of course, a time heist, why didn’t we think of this before? Right, because it’s a pipe dream. Who are you again?,Or screw it up worse than he already has.,Gotta say it. Sometimes I’ve missed that giddy optimism. Sadly, all your high hopes won’t help me if there’s no logical, tangible way for me to safely execute said “time heist.” I believe the most likely outcome would be our collective demise.,Stop, Scott. Stop. Are you telling me that your plan to save the universe is more than loosely based on Back to the Future?,Good. Because that would be horseshit. Scientifically speaking, your brother’s picture doesn’t disappear just ‘cause you went to the dance with your mom. That’s not how quantum physics works.,We did stand. And yet here we are.,Please don’t-,Fine.,No, Scott. I won’t. Even.,Good job. I’m saved. I wish you were coming here to ask me something else. I’m honestly happy to see you. If you want to stay-,Yeah, well, I got my second chance right here. I can’t roll the dice on it. The table is set for six. If you don’t talk shop, you’re welcome to stay for lunch.,Friday, you up?,I’ve had a mild inspiration, like to see if it checks out. I would like to run one last sim before we pack it in for the night. This time, in the shape of a Mobius Strip, inverted.,All right, give me the eigenvalue of that particle, factoring in spectral decomp. Run it. That’ll take a second. And don’t worry if it doesn’t pan out, I’m just kind of...,Shit.,What are you doing up?,First of all, that’s a Mommy word, she coined it.,I just had something on my mind.,Correct. Great minds think alike. What kind do you want?,You done? Now you are.,Once upon a time, Maguna went to bed. The end.,Love you tons.,Wow, that’s a lot.,Out like a light. Don’t know how much she loves you but she loves me three thousand.,What’re you reading?,I think I solved it.,Time travel.,Yeah.,To say the least.,I know-,I can’t help everybody.,Not if I stopped right here.,I could just lock the lab, put it in a trunk, sink it to the bottom of the lake, and go to bed.,Why the long face? Wild guess, he turned into a baby?,EPR Paradox. Instead of pushing Lang through time, you were pushing time through Lang. It’s dangerous. I probably should’ve cautioned you against it.,Thank god, I’m here. Regardless, I fixed it.,That is a fully-functioning, time- space GPS. I just want peace. Resentment is corrosive. I hate it.,We’ve got a shot at the Stones. I just need you to know my priorities. Bring back everyone we lost, hopefully. Keep what I found, definitely. And, let’s not die trying.,But wait, there’s more. Act now, and it comes with a bonus offer.,What’s to know? He made it for you. Plus, I gotta get it out of the garage before Morgan takes it sledding.,Just don’t flaunt it. I didn’t bring enough for the whole team. We are getting the whole team, right?,Out of the way, Lebowski.,Hey, Ratchet, you get lost in there?,And you’re only in there because you have tiny hands.,Thank you.,Tell me something good...,I think you mean nearly been killed by one of the six Infinity Stones.,Our history. Not all of them are going to be a fun drop-in.,Cross between ear-nose-and-throat and rabbit-from-hat.,Yeah. Sullivan Street.,Sullivan and Bleecker. They’re cross streets.,All right, you heard the man. Stroke those keys, Jolly Green.,Okay, Park Avenue’s that way. Let’s huddle up. Suits off.,Cap, I’ve got to say that outfit does nothing for your ass.,Ball’s in play. Head’s up, Cap.,Mind Stone’s on the move.,SHIELD. Actually, Hydra. But we didn’t know that yet.,You’re small but you’re talking loud.,One sec, just packing my lunch.,All right, you’re up, Little Buddy. There’s our stone,Okay, Cap, I make ten of them, just passing the 80th floor.,Already on my way.,Okay, Thumbelina, you’re a go.,Yeah, I had a can in the desk for emergencies. Can we focus, please?,Alexander Pierce. He’s the guy behind the guys behind Fury, so don’t mess.,I’m not gonna argue who has authority here but jurisdictionally speaking, we are on Stark property. That is my name on the glass...,Move it, Stuart Little. Things are getting dicey out here.,You’re only giving me a minor cardiac dysrhythmia-,Window’s closing. Pull my plug.,Meet me in the alley. I’m just gonna grab a slice at Famous Ray’s-,Our history. Not all of them are going to be a fun drop-in.,We’ve got a problem.,What do you want? I got hit in the head with a Hulk!,You’re not helping-,Okay, okay, Loki’s from Asgard, he’s comfortable there. Knows the restaurants. It’s a safe bet he visits home. If we can just grab This-Thor and explain the situation, he and I can fly-,I got it! There’s another way to re-take the Tesseract, and acquire new particles. Military installation, Garden State.,I have a vaguely exact idea.,I know they were there, and I know how I know.,All right, suits on. Try these coordinates. 04-07-19-70...,You trust me?,You weren’t actually born here, right?,All right. If I was SHIELD and I wanted to hide my quasi-fascistic black site, where would I hide it?,Good luck with that mission, Captain.,Come on, you little hexahedron, where are you hiding?,You may not know it now, but someday you’re going to be a real pain-in-the-ass.,No. Haven’t seen a soul.,No, sir. Just visiting from MIT.,Howard...,Potts.,That’d be swell.,Sauerkraut and a bouquet...big night planned?,Congratulations.,How far along is she?,I have a little girl.,Would that be so bad?,Got any names, yet?,You might let that stew a while. You’ve got time.,Yeah. I guess.,Wildly.,I pieced it together as I went along. I thought about what my dad did...,I tried to hold onto the good stuff. Dad dropped the odd pearl, here and there.,“No amount of money ever bought a second of time.”,He did his best.,You’re going to do fine, Howard.,Count on it...,Do we know if she had family?,I’m just asking a question-,Whoa, whoa, what are you doing-,Hold on, hold on-,That thing is channeling enough energy to light up a continent. You’re in no condition-,Good to go?,Okay, remember, everyone Thanos snapped away five years ago, you’re just bringing them back...to today. Don’t change anything from the last five years. Got it?,Friday, why don’t you go ahead and activate Barn Door Protocol?,Talk to me, Banner.,Don’t move him!,You lose this again, I’m keeping it.,Told you. We messed with time. Time messed back.,I read life signs, maybe 800 feet down, but it’s hard to tell.,What’s he been doing?,Yeah.,Somewhere under all of this. All I know is...he doesn’t have ‘em.,Don’t think I care.,Yep. We’re all kinds of stubborn.,There’s no way to send them back. Thanos destroyed our time machine.,Scott, how long do you need to get that thing working?,Doc. You said we win one in 14 million. Is this how it goes down?,You better be right.,Friday, what are they firing at?,And I...am Iron Man.,Everybody wants a happy ending. But it doesn’t always roll that way. Maybe this time.,I’m hoping if you play this back, it’s in celebration.,I hope families are reunited, I hope we get it back and something like a normal version of the planet has been restored. If there ever was such a thing.,God, what a world. Universe, now. If you’d told me ten years ago that we weren’t alone, let alone to this extent, I probably wouldn’t have been surprised. But come on...,Who knew what epic forces of dark and light would come into play? For better or worse, that’s the reality our children get to grow up in.,That’s why I thought I’d probably better record a little greeting, in the case of…an untimely death on my part.,I mean, death at any time is untimely, but...this “time travel” thing we’re going to try to pull off tomorrow has me scratching my head about the “survivability” of it all. But that’s the hero gig, right? Part of the journey is the end.,What am I even tripping for? Everything is going to work out exactly the way it’s supposed to.,I love you 3000."
NEBULA,"It was fun.,Don’t bother.,I can tell you where Thanos is.,Thanos spent a long time trying to...perfect me. When he worked, he talked. About his Great Plan. Even disassembled, I wanted to please him. I’d ask, where would we go once his plan was complete? His answer was always the same,Planet is unnamed, but inhabitable. Rich atmosphere, good soil-,Approaching jump in three, two...,That’s enough.,My father is many things. A liar is not one of them.,It was an infectious garbage scow.,Rhodey, careful on re-entry. There’s an idiot in the landing zone.,That’s not how it works.,Exactly.,Thanos found the Soul Stone on Vormir.,A dominion of death at the very center of celestial existence. It’s the place where Thanos murdered my sister.,Coordinates for Vormir are laid in. All they have to do is not fall out.,Let’s take cover. We’re not the only ones in this reality looking for the stones.,My father. My sister. And me.,I didn’t ask for your help.,Why?,Where?,Father’s plan is finally in motion.,It’s a start. If he gets them all...,He’ll miss it.,We will not fail you, father.,I swear I will make you proud-,Let’s take cover. We’re not the only ones in this reality looking for the stones.,I...don’t know. My head...splitting...,Yes.,Do you hear me complaining?,The tool of a thief. Come on.,What are you talking about?,I wasn’t always like this.,My father is many things. A liar is not one of them.,No. Please, father. That’s not me. I would never betray you. Please-,He knows...,Barton, Romanoff, come in. We have a problem. Thanos knows! Thanos-,You’re weak.,I’m you-,Shut up!,You could stop this. You know you want to. Did you see what happens in the future? Thanos finds the Soul Stone.,You want to know how he does that? You want to know what he does to you-,ENOUGH!,You disgust me...but that doesn’t mean you’re useless.,How do I look?,Yes, father...,Thank you, Father. They suspected nothing.,What will you do?,What do you want?,I try to kill you. Several times. But, eventually...we become friends. We become sisters.,A lot of things that happen will be hard to believe.,Father. I have the stones.,You’re betraying us?,You don’t have to do this.,I am this.,You’ve seen what we become-,Shut up. You’re a traitor!,You can change.,He won’t let me.,Your choices were him or a tree.,Sounds fair."
STEVE,"Neither could we.,We...lost...,We don’t know. He just opened a portal and walked through.,We’ve been hunting Thanos for three weeks - deep space scans, satellites - we got nothing. Tony, you fought him-,Did he give you anything to go on? Clues, coordinates-,Tony, I need you to focus-,But that didn’t work out, did it?,Where are you going?,Look, we realize “up there’s” more your territory, but this is our fight, too.,Where’s this garden?,A garden.,Yeah. Just like that.,Let’s go get that son of a bitch.,Because I don’t know what I’m going to do if it doesn’t.,Where are they?,What did you talk about?,That’s great. You’ve already done the hardest part. You took a jump, didn’t know where you’d come down. And that’s it, those little brave baby steps we’ve gotta take. To try to make us feel whole again, to find a purpose... I went into the ice right after I met the love of my life. Woke up seventy years later and...had to keep going.,The world’s been left in our hands. If we don’t do something with it...then Thanos might as well have killed all of us.,I’d offer to cook you dinner but you seem sad enough already.,And see a friend.,She leave the house today?,I spotted a pod of whales coming over the bridge.,Fewer ships, cleaner water. Just saying, there’s still a world out there.,Sorry. Force of habit.,I guess I don’t know how not to.,I keep telling them, move on. Grow past it. And some of them actually do. But not us.,Maybe it doesn’t need to be done.,I think we both need to get a life.,This an old message?,Scott, are you okay?,Scott, what are you talking about?,Wait...wait. Scott. Are you talking about a time machine?,Tony, after what you’ve seen, is anything really impossible?,Tony, the Stones exist in the past.

You’ve got this.,Get him back!,It’s a baby.,As a baby!,Among other things.,You did.,Me, too.,Sounds like a deal.,Tony, I don’t know-,Thank you, Tony.,We’re trying.,Okay. Now that we’ve got how, we’re going to need where and when.,Most folks here have encountered at least one of the six Infinity Stones-,Exactly. Let’s start with the Aether. Thor, what do we know?,Okay, we have a plan. Six stones, three teams, one shot.,Five years ago, we lost. All of us.,We lost friends. We lost family. We lost a part of ourselves. But today we have a chance to take it all back.,You have your teams and you have assignments. Get your stone, and get back here. One round trip each. No mistakes. No do-overs.,Most of us are going back to places we know. That doesn’t mean we know what to expect. Be careful. Look out for each other. Improvise, if you have to. This is the fight of our lives. And we’re going to win. Whatever it takes.,We’ve all got our assignments. Two stones uptown, one stone down. Stay low, keep an eye on time-,And Bruce? Maybe smash a few things along the way. For appearances.,No one asked you to look, Tony.,SHIELD’s coming up now.,I’m in position.,I’m on my way down to coordinate search and rescue.,“I’m on my way down to coordinate search and rescue.” I mean, really, how do you keep your food down?,Got it.

But this one’s on me.,Don’t do anything stupid ‘til I get back, okay?,It’s going to be okay, Buck.,You bet.,Hi, Sam.,I thought, after everything that’s happened...maybe I should try out some of that life Tony always told me to get.,It was beautiful.,Thanks.,That’s kind of why I’m here.,I had a little time to travel.

We met a few years ago. At the airport?,What? Yes.,Have either of you guys ever studied quantum physics?,Well, five years ago, just before this Thanos guy...I went into a place called the Quantum Realm. It’s like its own microscopic universe. You can only get there if you’re incredibly small. Hope, she’s my...she was supposed to pull me out. But then Thanos happened. And I was stuck in there.,Okay, but that’s the thing. It wasn’t. For me, it was only five hours. The rules in the Quantum Realm aren’t like out here. They’re completely unpredictable. Is anybody gonna eat that sandwich?,Time works differently in the Quantum Realm.,Problem is, right now, it’s chaos, there’s no way to navigate it. But what if we could figure out a way to enter the Quantum Realm at a certain point in time...and come out in another. Like, before Thanos-,No, not a machine. More like a... Yeah, like a time machine. I know it sounds crazy...,So, who do we talk to about this?,We know what it sounds like.,I did.,A time heist.,Still Scott...,Not if we strictly follow the rules of time travel. No talking to our past selves. No betting on sporting events-,No...,Look, Stark- Can I call you Tony?,Tony-,I get that you’ve got a lot on the line, here. You’ve got a wife. A daughter. But I lost someone very important - a lot of us did - and now we have a chance to save her, and everyone else, and you won’t even-,What are we gonna do? We need him. You want to stop?,Bigger than his?,I’m confused.,No, that’s not what I’m-,But why?,Okay. But how did...this happen?,You’re sure these modifications are safe?,Because the guy who invented this thing is pretty much a genius-,Yeah. And you look like that on purpose.,Excuse me?,Perfectly not confusing.,Yes, I do, Captain America. Yes, I-,Uh, guys? This doesn’t feel right.,Oh, my back!,Somebody peed my pants. I don’t know if it was baby-me or old-me. Or just me-me.,Um, kitchen, I think.,Oh, my God!,Easy, easy. Careful with those.,You’re being very Hulky-,These are Pym Particles. You can’t shrink to the Quantum Realm without them, and since Hank Pym got snapped out of existence, we can’t make any more. I told you. We’ve only got enough for one round trip each, no do-overs.,Plus two test runs-,One test run. Okay, maybe I’m not ready.,Sure, we can. We take the stones before Thanos gets them, then he doesn’t have them. Problem solved.,Apparently, Back to the Future is bullshit.,Just...saying.,Wait, like a planet...in space?,Not it.,I think you look great, Cap. As far as I’m concerned, that’s America’s ass.,Who are these guys?,Seriously? ‘Cause it’s kind of obvious they’re bad guys.,All right. Flick me.,Bombs away.,Is that...Axe body spray?,I’m going inside you...NOW.,This place is a mess. You promise you won’t die?,That doesn’t actually sound minor-,Here goes...,That wasn’t supposed to happen, was it?,You said we only had one shot. This was our shot. We shot it. It was six stones or nothing! Six stones-,You ruined the Time Heist!,Whoa, whoa. We don’t have any other options. We can’t go to any other times. No do-overs! We’ve only got one particle left, each. Use it now, that’s it, bye-bye, we don’t come home.,Hang on, what’s in New Jersey?,Wait! What are you improvising?,Steve- Cap- Captain America, if you do this and he’s wrong...you’re not coming back.,We should at least discuss it-,Guys, I think it-,Wait, what...?,No! Wait, I’m here!,HANG ON! I’M COMING!,Top floor, everybody out!,Hold on! That wasn’t our only time machine.,Uh, maybe ten minutes.,Ignition’s broken. I’ll hotwire it-,I was in prison. I know how to do a lot of things.,I’m almost there. Where’s the glove?,Thirty seconds!"
HULK,"These are confusing times.,I’m kidding, I get it. It’s crazy. I wear shirts now!,Five years ago, we got our asses kicked, right?,It was worse for me. Because I lost twice. First Hulk lost. Then Banner lost. Then we all lost.,I did- I feel like I’m the only one eating. Here, try some.,Thing is, I kept thinking, it didn’t have to be that way. That the best of Banner and best of Hulk, if they’d worked together, maybe they could’ve stopped Thanos.,For years I treated the Hulk like a disease, something to get rid of. But when I started treating him like the cure...,Eighteen months in the Gamma Lab. I put the brains and the brawn together. And now look at me. Best of both worlds.,100%, little lady.,Thanks, pal. Hulk out!,The time travel do-over? I don’t know, that’s kind of outside my field of expertise...,I’m supposed to be on Oprah next week, but I guess I could move things around.,I reran my calculations three times-,I have seven PhD’s, an MD, the Hans Bethe Award for Physics, and I’m personal friends with Bill Nye the Science Guy. We’re good.,Good. If we blow the grid, I don’t want to lose Tiny back in the ‘50’s.,I was kidding.,Honestly, I have no idea. We’re attempting time travel. Either it’s all a joke, or none of it is. We’re good! Helmet on.,Okay. I’m going to send you back one week, give you an hour to look around, then bring you back in ten seconds. Make sense?,Counting down from three, two, one...,Probably...?,I got it, I know exactly what’s going on. Pretty much.,It’s Scott.,When I tell you, kill the power! Now!,I call shotgun!,I’m kind of famous...,They lost Asgard, then half their people. Maybe they’re just happy to have a home.,Hey, Valkyrie! Great to see you!,This is Rocket.,We didn’t say we were here to see-,It’s that bad?,Hello...? Thor...?,Thor?,Hey, guys. Long time no-,Hey, buddy, are you all right?,We need your help. There’s a chance we can fix everything.,Like Thanos.,Please take your hand off me.,Now, I know the thought of...that guy might scare you-,Look, I get it. You’re in a rough patch. I’ve been there. But you know who helped me out of it?,It was you. You helped me. And I need you to help me again.,That’s the thing. I think we can bring them back.,Come on, pal. We need you.,I’m being very careful-,Okay, Clint, you might feel a little disoriented when you chronoshift-,Uh, one, because that’s horrible. And, two, killing baby Thanos doesn’t kill adult Thanos. Time doesn’t work like that. You can’t change the future by changing the past.,Heard from who?,WHY DOES EVERYONE THINK THIS? THAT’S NOT TRUE. IF YOU TRAVEL TO THE PAST, THEN THAT PAST HAS BECOME YOUR PRESENT, AND YOUR FORMER PRESENT HAS BECOME THE PAST, WHICH NOW CAN’T BE CHANGED BY YOUR NEW FUTURE!,Okay, Clint. Starting in three, two, one...,Regardless, we’ve only got enough Pym Particles for one round trip, each. And the Stones have been in a lot of places throughout history.,That’s a person?,Strange?,Had a nice place in the Village.,Bleecker.,Shut the front door...,Tracking beacons engaged.,Actually, it’ll be closer to seven or eight microseconds, give or-,All right, but I have to say, it seems gratuitous.,Grrr...grrr...,Hulk...does what...Hulk want?,I’m looking for Dr. Strange.,Well, that, actually.,I’m seriously sorry but...I wasn’t asking.,You’re right, I don’t. But I need that stone, and I don’t have a lot of time to debate it-,Hulk take stairs.,SO MANY STAIRS!,Thank you.,-the Stones have been in a lot of places throughout history.,Did we get them all?,Where’s Nat? WHERE’S NAT?!,She’s not coming back. We have to make it worth it. We have to.,Lightning won’t help you, pal. It’s gotta be me. You saw what those stones did to Thanos. They almost killed him. None of you could survive.,We don’t. But the radiation’s mostly gamma. It’s like I was made for this...,Let’s do it.,Got it.,Everybody’s coming home...,I’m...okay...,Did it work?,Rhodey. Rocket. Get out of here. Save yourselves.,AAARRRGH!,No! We need to send them back where they came from.,Remember, you’ll have to return the stones to the exact moment they were taken. Otherwise, we’re still looking at a whole bunch of nasty alternate realities.,You know, I tried. When I had the gauntlet. I really tried to bring her back. I miss her.,You’d better get going. We’re almost ready for you.,For him, as long as he needs. For us, five seconds. Ready, Cap? You’re good to go. Meet you right back here, okay?,Going Quantum in three, two, one.,Aaand, returning in five... four...three...two...one-,I don’t know. He blew past our time stamp. He should be here.,I’m trying.,I’M TRYING!"
GAMORA,"You’re welcome?,And yet you always need it. Father wants us back on the ship.,He’s found an Infinity Stone.,On a planet called “Morag.”,One stone isn’t six.,We’ll never have to do this again.,He won’t like it.,Sister, what’s-,Who was that?,Her synaptic drive was probably damaged in battle-,Terrans?,I don’t understand. Two Nebulas?,What did you do to them?,The stones.,In the future...what happens to you and me?,That’s hard to believe.,Come on. We can still stop him.,Stop.,Not you.,No. You’re not.,Sister, listen to her-,This is the one? Seriously?"
QUILL,"Oh, fu-,Gamora?,I thought I lost you.,You missed the first time...then you got ‘em both the second time.,Babe? Gamora?,You know, I’m still in charge, here, right?,See, when you keep swiping my map, that sounds kind of like, “of course, I know you think you’re still in charge-”,That’s not necessary...,No one’s using knives!,Me. Right?"
HOWARD,"Hey, Arnim, you in here?,Hey, I’m looking for Dr. Zola. You seen him?,I know you?,That so? Got a name?,Easy to remember-,I’m Howard Stark. You seem a little green around the gills, Potts. Need some air?,Need the briefcase?,My wife’s expecting. And too much time at the office.,Thanks.,...this far. She’s at the point where she can’t stand the sound of my chewing. So I guess I’ll be eating in the pantry again.,A girl would be nice. Less chance she’d turn out exactly like me.,Let’s just say the greater good hasn’t always outweighed my own self interest.,If it’s a boy, my wife likes Elmonzo.,What are you, couple years older than me?,Let me ask you a question. When your kid was born...were you nervous?,Did you feel qualified?

Isn’t that right?,Well, good to meet you, Potts.,Thanks. See you around?,Have we met him before?,Seems very familiar. Weird beard."
PEGGY,"So, send them in.,Oh, for the love of- I’ll find the weather projections. You call Braddock and tell him to shelter in place. Assuming he’s bright enough to come out of the rain.,Here we are...,Crikey O’Reilly. Sergeant? Hang up and call Air Command. Braddock needs back up, immediately.,Those aren’t lightning strikes he’s looking at..."
PETER,"Mr. Stark. Holy cow, you would not believe what’s been going on. Do you remember when we were in space? And I got all dusty? I must’ve passed out, because I woke up and you weren’t there, but Dr. Strange was, and he was like, “it’s been five years, they need us.” And he started doing that yellow sparkly thing he does-,Oh. This is nice.,I GOT IT!,Activate instant kill!,I got this...I got this...I don’t got this.,Hey, nice to meet you-aaaaarg!,Uh, hey. I’m Peter Parker.,I don’t know how you’re gonna get it through all that-,Mr. Stark...Tony...it’s okay, it’s okay...Mr. Stark, we won. You did it, sir..."
